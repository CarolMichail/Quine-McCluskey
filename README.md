 Logic minimzation using Quine Mcluskey' Algorithm, by knzy, jana, and carol
How to build the program: using a normal cpp compiler, and you need to have a text file specifying the number of bits in the first line, number of minterms in the second line
and they have to be seperated by a space, and same thing in line 3 for don't care terms.
This project imiatates Quinn Mcluskey's Boolean Logic Minimization Algorithm, as mentioned it takes the input whether it's minterms or minterms and don't care terms along with the number of bits in the binary number and starts to create the implication table and coverage chart which eventually helps produce a minimized boolean expression.
