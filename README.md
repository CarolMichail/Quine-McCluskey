 Logic minimzation using Quine Mcluskey' Algorithm, by knzy, jana, and carol
How to build the program: using a normal cpp compiler, and you need to have a text file specifying the number of bits in the first line, number of minterms in the second line
and they have to be seperated by a space, and same thing in line 3 for don't care terms.
